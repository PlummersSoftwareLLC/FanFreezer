## PlatformIO

This project uses PlatformIO as its build framework, which also means it can be most easily worked on with the PlatformIO IDE.

More information about PlatformIO can be found on the [PlatformIO website](https://platformio.org/) and in its [documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/).
